#### Variables in Python

Variables are temporary storage spaces used to hold data values, which can change throughout the execution of a program.

- **Naming Rules**:
  - Must start with a **letter** or an **underscore (_)**:
    ```python
    my_variable = 10
    _variable = "test"
    ```
  - Cannot start with a **number**:
    ```python
    1_variable = 10  # ❌ Invalid!
    ```
  - Can only contain **alphanumeric characters** and **underscores** (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _):
    ```python
    Num_1 = 5  # ✔ Valid!
    ```
  - Variable names are **case-sensitive**:
    ```python
    age = 20
    Age = 30
    AGE = 40
    # All are different variables!
    ```

- A variable name **cannot** be any of the [Python Keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp).

> **Remember:** Variables are the building blocks of any program. Choose meaningful names that reflect their purpose!
